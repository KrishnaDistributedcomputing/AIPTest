| UserId             | The UPN of the user who performed the action (specified in the Operation property) that resulted in the record being logged; for example, my_name@my_domain_name. <br><br>Note that records for activity performed by system accounts (such as SHAREPOINT\system or NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) are also included. In SharePoint, another value display in the UserId property is app@sharepoint. This indicates that the "user" who performed the activity was an application that has the necessary permissions in SharePoint to perform organization-wide actions (such as search a SharePoint site or OneDrive account) on behalf of a user, admin, or service. For more information, see the [app@sharepoint user in audit records](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?view=o365-worldwide#the-appsharepoint-user-in-audit-records).                       |
| ClientIP           | The IP address of the device that was used when the activity was logged. The IP address is displayed in either an IPv4 or IPv6 address format. For some services, the value displayed in this property might be the IP address for a trusted application (for example, Office on the web apps) calling into the service on behalf of a user and not the IP address of the device used by person who performed the activity. Also, for Azure Active Directory-related events, the IP address isn't logged and the value for the ClientIP property is null. The IP address is displayed in either an IPv4 or IPv6 address format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
