## AipFileDeleted

AipFileDeleted is a type of event that is recorded in the Office 365 Unified Audit Log. It represents a successful attempt to delete an Azure Information Protection (AIP) labeled file. This event is typically logged when a user with the appropriate permissions uses the AIP client to delete a file that has been labeled with AIP.

Azure Information Protection is a service that allows organizations to classify and label sensitive data, and apply policies to control how that data is accessed and shared. The AipFileDeleted event can be useful for tracking and monitoring the deletion of AIP labeled files, and ensuring that only authorized users are able to delete such files.

Some common attributes of the AipFileDeleted event type in the Unified Audit Log include:

1. CreationTime: The date and time when the event was logged.
2.  UserId: The user who performed the delete action.
3. ClientIP: The IP address of the client that was used to perform the delete action.
4. Operation: The type of operation that was performed, in this case "AipFileDeleted".
5. ResultStatus: The result of the operation, either "Success" or "Failure".
6. ObjectId: The unique identifier of the file that was deleted.

You can use the Search-UnifiedAuditLog PowerShell cmdlet to search for AipFileDeleted events in the Unified Audit Log, and use the Select-Object cmdlet to specify which attributes you want to include in the results.

Here is an example of a complex PowerShell script that can be used to extract information from the AipFileDeleted event type in the Office 365 Unified Audit Log:

Before connecting to Unified Audit Log - we need to connect with Exchange Online using PowerShell, you can use the following steps:

Open a PowerShell window and run the Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement command to install the Exchange Online Management module. This module provides cmdlets that can be used to manage Exchange Online.

command to prompt for your Exchange Online credentials.
```powershell
Run the $UserCredential = Get-Credential 
```
command to connect to Exchange Online using the provided credentials. 
```powershell
Run the Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $UserCredential -ShowProgress $true 
```

## Establishing remote Powershell session
This will establish a remote PowerShell session with Exchange Online.Once the connection is established, you can run Exchange Online cmdlets to manage your Exchange Online environment. For example, you can run the Get-Mailbox cmdlet to retrieve a list of mailboxes in your Exchange Online organization.

This script will import the Exchange Online cmdlets, connect to Exchange Online using the current user's credentials, get the AipFileDeleted events from the last 24 hours, extract the user ID, file name, file type, file path, and file deletion time from the events, and then disconnect from Exchange Online.

You can modify this script to suit your specific needs, such as changing the time period for the events you want to retrieve, or adding additional fields to extract from the events.

```powershell
# Import the Exchange Online cmdlets
Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement

# Connect to Exchange Online using the credentials in the current session
Connect-ExchangeOnline

# Get the AipFileDeleted events from the last 24 hours
$events = Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate (Get-Date).AddHours(-24) -EndDate (Get-Date) -RecordType AipFileDeleted

# Extract the information you want from the events
$events | Select-Object UserId, FileName, FileType, FilePath, FileDeletionTime

# Disconnect from Exchange Online
Disconnect-ExchangeOnline
```


# Additional samples

```powershell
# Set the date range for the search
$startDate = Get-Date -Year 2020 -Month 1 -Day 1
$endDate = Get-Date

# Search the Unified Audit Log for AipFileDeleted events in the specified date range
$auditEvents = Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate $startDate -EndDate $endDate -Operations AipFileDeleted

# Extract the relevant information from each event
$results = $auditEvents | Select-Object CreationTime, UserId, ClientIP, Operation, ResultStatus, FileName

# Write the results to a CSV file
$results | Export-Csv -Path C:\AipFileDeleted-Audit.csv -NoTypeInformation
```
This script first sets the date range for the search using the Get-Date cmdlet, and then uses the Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet to search for AipFileDeleted events within that date range. Next, the script uses the Select-Object cmdlet to extract the relevant information from each event, including the creation time, user ID, client IP, operation type, result status, and file name. Finally, the script exports the results to a CSV file using the Export-Csv cmdlet.

This is just one example of how the Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet can be used to extract information from the Unified Audit Log. You may need to adjust the script and specify additional parameters based on your specific requirements. For more information about the cmdlets and their parameters, you can refer to the Microsoft documentation or use the PowerShell Get-Help command.

| UserId             | The UPN of the user who performed the action (specified in the Operation property) that resulted in the record being logged; for example, my_name@my_domain_name. <br><br>Note that records for activity performed by system accounts (such as SHAREPOINT\system or NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) are also included. In SharePoint, another value display in the UserId property is app@sharepoint. This indicates that the "user" who performed the activity was an application that has the necessary permissions in SharePoint to perform organization-wide actions (such as search a SharePoint site or OneDrive account) on behalf of a user, admin, or service. For more information, see the [app@sharepoint user in audit records](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?view=o365-worldwide#the-appsharepoint-user-in-audit-records).                       |
| ClientIP           | The IP address of the device that was used when the activity was logged. The IP address is displayed in either an IPv4 or IPv6 address format. For some services, the value displayed in this property might be the IP address for a trusted application (for example, Office on the web apps) calling into the service on behalf of a user and not the IP address of the device used by person who performed the activity. Also, for Azure Active Directory-related events, the IP address isn't logged and the value for the ClientIP property is null. The IP address is displayed in either an IPv4 or IPv6 address format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
