## AipHeartBeat

AzureInformationProtectionHeartbeat is a record type in the audit log for Azure Information Protection (AIP). AIP is a security service that helps organizations protect their sensitive data by applying labels and policies to classify and encrypt the data.

The AzureInformationProtectionHeartbeat record type tracks the health and status of the AIP service. It logs events such as when the service starts and stops, when the service encounters errors or issues, and when the service is being used by users.

The AzureInformationProtectionHeartbeat record type is useful for monitoring the health and performance of the AIP service, as well as for troubleshooting any issues that may arise with the service. You can use the Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet in PowerShell to search for AIP HeartBeat events in the audit log.

## Using Powershell to extract information related to AIPHeartBeat.

The Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet in PowerShell allows you to search for specific record types in the audit log. To search for AIP HeartBeat events, you would use the AzureInformationProtectionHeartbeat record type.

For example, the following command will search for all AIP HeartBeat events that were generated within the last week:

```powershell
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -RecordType AipHeartbeat -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays-7) -EndDate (Get-Date)
```
### What are RecordType
RecordType: The workload that generated the record. Examples of different types of events that can be found using the Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet include:

Adding a member to a group in Azure Active Directory(**AzureActiveDIrectory**)
Updating mailbox properties in Exchange (**ExchangeAdmin**)
Deleting a file in SharePoint (**SharePointFileOperation**)
A user logging onto Microsoft Teams ((**MicrosoftTeams**)
AIP Heartbeat(**AipHeartbeat**)


These events can be searched for and tracked using the Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet, which allows you to filter and view the details of the events that are recorded in the unified audit log.


The following table contain information related to AIP heartbeat events.

| UserId             | The UPN of the user who performed the action (specified in the Operation property) that resulted in the record being logged; for example, my_name@my_domain_name. <br><br>Note that records for activity performed by system accounts (such as SHAREPOINT\system or NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) are also included. In SharePoint, another value display in the UserId property is app@sharepoint. This indicates that the "user" who performed the activity was an application that has the necessary permissions in SharePoint to perform organization-wide actions (such as search a SharePoint site or OneDrive account) on behalf of a user, admin, or service. For more information, see the [app@sharepoint user in audit records](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?view=o365-worldwide#the-appsharepoint-user-in-audit-records).                       |
| ClientIP           | The IP address of the device that was used when the activity was logged. The IP address is displayed in either an IPv4 or IPv6 address format. For some services, the value displayed in this property might be the IP address for a trusted application (for example, Office on the web apps) calling into the service on behalf of a user and not the IP address of the device used by person who performed the activity. Also, for Azure Active Directory-related events, the IP address isn't logged and the value for the ClientIP property is null. The IP address is displayed in either an IPv4 or IPv6 address format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
